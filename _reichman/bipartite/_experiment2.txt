Things for Experiment 2:
    - Larger Coefficients Intervals: Only use whole numbers (should reduce experiments by 50%)
    - Larger Coefficients: Explore up to C = 30 (15log(n)), but then also C = 50, 72, and 100 (Should increase number of experiments by 50%)
    - Larger Node Intervals: Only use intervals of 10k (should reduce experiments by 50%)
    - Fewer Trials: Only use 2 trials per experiment (Should reduce experiments by 80%)
    - Ensure that all graphs are the same for different epsilon (Should reduce computations for baseline Greedy)
    - Pre-generate the entire experimental design and have all batches pull from the same script 
    - Institute file locking
    - Reduce nodes/memory to increase number of jobs at once
    - Learn how to auto submit identical batch jobs that will create the maximum computational resources, since it will be pulling from the same file


Coeffecients: range(2, 30, 2) + [50, 72, 100]
Nodes: range(10000, 200000, 10000) + [2500, 5000]
Epsilon: range(0, 0.25, 0.025)
Number of Trials: 2
Seed: 42 + Trial ID (should be either 0 or 1)
